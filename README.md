# Pitfall Harry

Harry coming back on 32Blit.
Remake of David Crane's Atari 2600 Jump and Run from 1982.

The player must maneuver Pitfall Harry through a maze-like jungle in order to recover 32 gold coins in a period of 30 minutes. On the way he has to overcome numerous dangers. There is a tunnel under the jungle that Harry can enter through ladders. When you travel through the tunnel, you move three screens at the same time, which is necessary to collect all the coins within the time limit. But be careful, you can easily miss a gold coin and the way back costs valuable time!
